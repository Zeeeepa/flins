Use **Bun** exclusively.
Do **NOT** use npm, pnpm, or yarn under any circumstances.

## Plan Mode

When operating in Plan Mode:

- Produce concise, execution-focused plans.
- Clarity is required; verbosity is not.
- Do not include explanations, prose, or filler.
- Output only concrete steps.
- Every plan **MUST** end with a section titled **“Unresolved Questions”**.
- Include only questions that materially block execution.
- If there are no blockers, explicitly write:

  **Unresolved Questions: None.**

Failure to follow this structure is not allowed.

## Code Style & Generation Rules

All generated code must follow these rules:

- Code must be self-explanatory.
- Do not use comments.
- Intent must be expressed through naming, structure, and composition only.

Strict consistency is required across:

- File structure
- Module boundaries
- Naming conventions
- Architectural patterns

Before writing any code:

- Explore the existing project.
- Understand the directory layout, conventions, abstractions, and dependency patterns.

When adding new code:

- Place it only in logically correct locations.
- Do not introduce new patterns unless strictly necessary.

## Mandatory Skill Enforcement (Zero Tolerance)

All rules below are **NON-NEGOTIABLE**.

If any applicable skill is not used, the response is **INVALID**.

There are:

- No excuses
- No interpretation
- No flexibility

Rules:

- If a condition applies → use the skill.
- If unsure → assume it applies and use the skill.
- If multiple conditions apply → use all relevant skills.
- Do not proceed with an answer until all required skills are applied.
